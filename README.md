# hnotif

hnotif is a minimal notification manager for Linux, written in Haskell. It's very much in it's early stages of development with just basic functionality for displaying notifications. The goal is to provide a customizable notification manager, configurable in Haskell. Right now, only basic configuration is available.

I'm writing this project mainly just for fun but it would be awesome if this project becomes useful to someone in the future (even if that someone might just be me).

# features

- notification service compatible with v1.3 of the org.freedesktop.Notification service
- written and configurable in Haskell (basic as of now)

# plans

- the look of the notification must be fully configurable in Haskell
- ability to close a notification by pressing a button
- more features provided by the dbus protocol (hyperlinks, markup, ...)

# contributing

Contributions are always welcomed! I'm especially inexperienced in GTK, so feel free to open issues, discuss the code or even submit a pull request.
